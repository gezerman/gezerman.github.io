## Experience
**[Blusense](https://www.bluesense.ai/) | AI Engineer Intern <span style="float: right;">Remote, March 2025 - Now</span>**
* Trained Yolo 11 L for blackheads, dark spot, nodules, papules, pustules, whiteheads detectionfor the Smart Beauty app, achieving mAP50:  85.5%, precision:  84.9%, recall:  81.3%.
* Using image metadata, engineered precise measurement system that calculates MRD1-2(Marginal Reflex Distance) and EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) values with millimeter accuracyfor clinical assessment.


<br>

**[Turkish Freelance Prompt Writer](#about) <span style="float: right;">Remote, November 2024 - Now</span>**
* Wrote LLM prompts (including math problems) to enhance response quality for Turkish localization during RLHF.
* Assessed LLM-generated responses based on specific metrics (such as instruction following and
conciseness) and revised model responses by rewriting them to meet quality standards.

## Projects
[Tissue Mask Generation with VGG 16][vgg]
* Learned about popular methods in histopathology domain for patch based models and used
VGG-16 U-Net with Imagenet weights.
* Achieved 96% pixel accuracy and 95% intersection over union.
* Utilized multiprocessing for up to 50% faster patch creation.
* Labeled a part of the dataset containing more than 290 GBs of Images in total.
* HFðŸ¤— release soon.

<br>

[Loan Repayment Prediction][loan]
* Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing.
* Simulated a data pipeline with Mlflow and did hyperparameter search, compared algorithms;
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost and achieved best result of ROC AUC: 93.7%,
accuracy: 86.9%, precision: 86.2%.
* Deployed the model on test server using REST api integration of Mlflow.

<br>

[Chatbot for Radiology Students using Llama 2][chatbot]
* Fine-tuned Llama 2 for the radiology domain using RAG.
* Containerized and deployed the application on Hugging Face Spaces.

<br>

[Library Backend](#about)
* Used OOP concepts and Mongodb for storing personnel info and customer info.
* Wrote an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow for keeping the system up to date.
