## Experience
**[Blusense](https://www.bluesense.ai/) | AI Engineer Intern <span style="float: right;">Remote, March 2025 - June 2025</span>**
* Trained Yolo 11 L for blackheads, dark spot, nodules, papules, pustules, whiteheads detectionfor the Smart Beauty app, achieving mAP50:  85.5%, precision:  84.9%, recall:  81.3%.
* Using image metadata, engineered precise measurement system that calculates MRD1-2(Marginal Reflex Distance) and EAR (Eye Aspect Ratio) values with millimeter accuracyfor clinical assessment.
* Designed and deployed a Flask-based REST API for droopy eyelid detection and integrated swagger
documentation.

<br>

**[Turkish Data Annotator](#about) <span style="float: right;">Remote, November 2024 - Now</span>**
* Wrote LLM prompts (including undergrad level math problems) to enhance response quality
for Turkish localization during RLHF and assessed model responses based on specific metrics, revising
model responses by rewrites to meet quality standards.

<br>

**[Mitsubishi Electric](https://tr.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/products/rbt#) | Intern<span style="float: right;">Istanbul, July 2023 â€“ August 2023</span>**
* Developed a demo using OpenCV and Melfa Basic for server-robot communication to solve mazes on printed
paper.
* Gained hands-on experience applications involving industrial robots and computer vision.
* Contributed to company documentation.

## Projects
[Tissue Mask Generation with VGG 16][vgg]
* Learned about popular methods in histopathology domain for patch based models and used
VGG-16 U-Net with Imagenet weights.
* Using gradio, uploaded a [demo] that showcases the model on HuggingFace ðŸ¤— spaces
* Achieved 96% pixel accuracy and 95% intersection over union.
* Utilized multiprocessing for up to 50% faster patch creation and uplodaded the dataset on Hugging Face.
* Labeled a part of the dataset containing more than 290 GBs of Images in total.

<br>
[Phone Processors Dataset][processors]
* An extensive collection documenting 204 mobile processor variants across major manufacturers, including practical daily use score, standardized benchmark results (AnTuTu, Geekbench multi-core and single-core), core configuration details, peak turbo clock speeds, and GPU models.


<br>

[Loan Repayment Prediction][loan]
* Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing.
* Simulated a data pipeline with Mlflow and did hyperparameter search, compared algorithms;
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost and achieved best result of ROC AUC: 93.7%,
accuracy: 86.9%, precision: 86.2%.
* Deployed the model on test server using REST api integration of Mlflow.

<br>

[Chatbot for Radiology Students using Llama 2][chatbot]
* Trained quantized Llama 2 Lora for the radiology domain using PEFT
* Used chromadb for implementing RAG and used streamlit for chat ui
* Containerized and deployed the application on Hugging Face Spaces.

<br>

[Library Backend](#about)
* Used OOP concepts and Mongodb for storing personnel info and customer info.
* Wrote an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow for keeping the system up to date.
