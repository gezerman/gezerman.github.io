## Projects
[Tissue Mask Generation with VGG 16][vgg]
* Learned about popular methods in histopathology domain for patch based models and used
VGG-16 U-Net with Imagenet weights.
* Using gradio, uploaded a [demo] that showcases the model on HuggingFace 🤗 spaces
* Achieved 96% pixel accuracy and 95% intersection over union.
* Utilized multiprocessing for up to 50% faster patch creation and uplodaded the dataset on Hugging Face.
* Labeled a part of the dataset containing more than 290 GBs of Images in total.

<br>

[Phone Processors Dataset][processors]
* An extensive collection documenting 204 mobile processor variants across major manufacturers, including practical daily use score, standardized benchmark results (AnTuTu, Geekbench multi-core and single-core), core configuration details, peak turbo clock speeds, and GPU models.

<br>

[Loan Repayment Prediction][loan]
* Performed exploratory data analysis and preprocessing.
* Simulated a data pipeline with Mlflow and did hyperparameter search, compared algorithms;
Random Forest, Decision Tree, XGBoost and achieved best result of ROC AUC: 93.7%,
accuracy: 86.9%, precision: 86.2%.
* Deployed the model on test server using REST api integration of Mlflow.

<br>

[Chatbot for Radiology Students using Llama 2][chatbot]
* Trained quantized Llama 2 Lora for the radiology domain using PEFT
* Used chromadb for implementing RAG and used streamlit for chat ui
* Containerized and deployed the application on Hugging Face Spaces.

<br>

[Library Backend](#about)
* Used OOP concepts and Mongodb for storing personnel info and customer info.
* Wrote an ETL pipeline using Apache Airflow for keeping the system up to date.
